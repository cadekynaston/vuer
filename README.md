## Project Details
This was my first attempt at creating something using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and I found it to be very enjoyable. The docs are great and the syntax is pretty easy to pick up.

I knocked out a list of things I have been wanting to learn by doing this project, besides Vue, including [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Zeit](https://zeit.co/), and [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

Unfortunately I didn't realize GitHub has a [GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) until I was pretty much done with the project or else I would have used that.

## Tech Stack
